## CHAPTER I
**THE CANOE BUILDER**

Dick stood firm on a rugged ledge of coral, his gaze drawn southward. Behind him, the relentless breakers of the open ocean crashed against the reef, sending showers of spindrift that danced in the wind. Before him stretched a vista of serene blue, an ocean calmed to the stillness of a lake, alive with the graceful flight of fishing gulls – the lagoon of Karolin.

Enclosed within its forty-mile embrace of coral, this vast expanse was a world unto itself. A tempestuous sea in the face of strong winds, yet a tranquil pool of azure under gentle breezes – and it was *his*. He had arrived but yesterday, yet already, it was his.

He surveyed the scene before him. Women, children, and young men bustled along the sun-drenched beach, some casting nets, others engaged in playful games, while still others diligently worked on the paraka patches. All, he knew, were now his people. The canoes, pulled high upon the sand, were his to command. The empty houses, once echoing with the presence of war canoes resting on their rollers, were his to oversee.

But as his gaze shifted from the tranquil lagoon to the empty canoe houses, a shadow crossed his brow. Turning his back to the peaceful waters, he faced the turbulent breakers of the outer beach and the boundless northern sea. Somewhere beyond that distant horizon, invisible yet ever-present in his mind, lay Palm Tree. An island of exquisite beauty, a vision of paradise, yet a place teeming with devils.

Little Tari, son of Le Taioi, the net maker, sat nearby on the coral. He looked up at Taori with wide, innocent eyes. Tari was young and knew little of the world, but he understood that the men of Karolin, swept away by war, had left the women and children defenseless, without a leader.

Then, yesterday, from the northern sea, a strange boat had appeared. In it was Katafa, a girl lost to the sea years ago while fishing, and this striking new figure, Taori. The women whispered he was sent by the gods to be their chief, their ruler.

The child knew nothing of gods and cared even less. Alone now with this captivating stranger, and beyond the hearing of his mother, he voiced the question that burned in his young mind. He asked it with the simple directness of childhood.

“Taori,” little Tari began, his voice clear and unafraid, “who are you?” (é kamina tai).

Could Dick have answered, would the child have even grasped the strange tale he might have told? "Tari, I come from a world beyond your knowing. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was smaller than you, I was left alone with an old sailor on that island you call Marua – Palm Tree. There we lived, and there I grew. Kearney, as he was called, taught me to fish and spear, and he crafted toys for me: little ships unlike the canoes of these islands. Then, Tari, one day long ago, Katafa, the girl lost in the storm, came to us. She stayed with us until Kearney passed, and then we were alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin. She named me Taori. We loved one another, and might have lived forever on Marua had not a great ship arrived, filled with cruel men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They came to cut down the trees. They rose up, killed the white men among them, and burned the ship. In our boat, we escaped, taking with us all we held dear, even the little ships. Guided by the lagoon light in the sky, we steered for Karolin."

But he couldn't recount this to Tari, or at least not all of it. The name "Dick" had faded from his memory, and the language he once spoke as a child had all but vanished. Kearney, the sailor who had raised him, was nearly forgotten, lost in the shimmering haze that was his past.

The past, for those long shipwrecked and alone, becomes blurred and indistinct. For Dick, it began with Katafa's arrival on Marua. Before that, all was forgotten, consumed by the intense blaze of tropic light that bathed the island and the sea, the storms that ravaged the coconut groves, the mists of the rainy seasons. Kearney would have been entirely lost to memory, were it not for the little ships he had fashioned as playthings for the boy who was now a man.

He looked down at the inquisitive child. “I am Taori, Tari tatu, why do you ask?”

“I do not know,” the child replied. “I ask as I breathe, but no big folk – madyana – will ever answer the questions of Tari. Ai, the fish!” His attention, ever fleeting, was drawn by the shouts of other children hauling in a net. He scrambled to his feet and ran off.

Dick turned his gaze once more to the north. The child's question had stirred something within him, conjuring a vision of the schooner that had anchored at Palm Tree, only to be consumed by fire at the hands of the Melanesians. He saw Katafa and himself fleeing in the old dinghy, the one Kearney had taught him to handle as a boy. He relived their arrival on this very beach yesterday, the women and children swarming around him, hailing him as the man sent by the gods to be their chief.

As he stared northward, the memory of the men from whom he and Katafa had fled tainted the beauty of the sea and sky.

There was no immediate threat from the men who now occupied Palm Tree. They possessed no canoes. But they would build them, of that he was certain. They would inevitably see the far-off mirror-like gleam of Karolin lagoon in the sky, just as he had, and they would come. It might be long in coming, but they would come.

Dick was now almost a kanaka, a savage, yet the white man remained within him. He could think ahead, he could analyze a situation, and he possessed the power of imagination.

That was why he had sent a canoe that very morning to the southern beach, to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata – three old men, too old for war, but masters of canoe building. It was why, when surveying the assembled tribe, his eyes had lit upon the nearly one hundred youths who were ripening into warriors. But above all, fueling his mind, soaring with daring to impossible heights, was his love for Katafa, his other half, more precious to him than his own life, a being threatened, however distantly, by the shadows of the past.

War canoes! Did he plan to confront any invaders in the lagoon, or as they approached the shore? Or did he harbor a deeper intention, to eradicate the danger at its source before it could fully materialize? Who could truly know?

A hand rested upon his shoulder. He turned to find himself face-to-face with Katafa. A strand of her dark hair, freed from the vine that bound it, danced in the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her luminous eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the very point to which he had been gazing – the distant northern sea line.

“Look!” Katafa breathed, her voice hushed.

Under specific weather conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, became visible from Karolin through mirage. They had seen it the previous evening, and now it was beginning to rise again, to bloom into life. A mysterious stain low in the sky, a dull mark in the sea's bright dazzle, gradually deepened and solidified. As if drawn by an unseen hand, the island appeared, beautiful as a dream, ethereal yet vivid.

Hand resting on his shoulder, they stood in silence, their minds unburdened by knowledge of mirage. Their eyes were fixed on the place from which they had escaped, now rising so strangely beyond the sea line as if to peer back at them.

They saw again the horde of savages on the beach, figures as monstrous as the creatures of a nightmare. They felt the wind fill the sail as the dinghy raced for safety on the open sea. They heard once more the drunken yells of the Melanesians, maddened by stolen rum from the schooner they had brought in, then burned. And there, before them, lay the scene of the tragedy, a lovely picture that betrayed nothing of the demons who still haunted it.

As Dick gazed upon this beauty that was also a threat, a warning, his nostrils flared and his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him – but that was inconsequential. They had threatened Katafa – that was everything. And they *still* threatened her.

Someday, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo the instinct that whispered in his ear. They would build canoes, and seeing the lagoon's mirror-light in the sky, they would come. They had no women, those men, and here there were women. Instinct told him that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so too would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon, searching for an island whose tribe could be raided for its women, and seeing the lagoon light, they would come.

If only he had known, danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred might roam on that azure sea. Not only amongst savages, but also the wolves of civilization.

To Dick, there was no world beyond the watery circle that enclosed the two islands. No Europe, no America, no history but the history of his short life and the life of Katafa. Yet even within that life, brief as it was, he had learned to fear men, and he had glimpsed the essence of all history: man’s instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.

Gradually, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade and disappear, vanishing suddenly like a snuffed candle. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.

It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral ledge, they descended to the white sands of the inner beach to meet it.
