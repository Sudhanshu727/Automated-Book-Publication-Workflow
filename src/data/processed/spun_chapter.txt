## CHAPTER I
## THE CANOE BUILDER

Dick stood poised on a jagged ledge of coral, his gaze drawn southward. Behind him, the relentless breakers of the open ocean crashed and roared, their misty spray flung skyward by the wind. Before him stretched a lagoon, Karolin's lagoon, as tranquil and boundless as a cerulean lake. Fishing gulls wheeled and cried overhead, their calls echoing across the still water.

Enclosed within a forty-mile ring of coral, this vast expanse felt like a sea unto itself. In fierce winds, it transformed into a tempestuous arena, yet in gentle breezes, it became a haven of azure peace. To Dick, newly arrived, it felt like his domain.

Women, children, and young men populated the beach, all moving with purpose under the fierce sun. Some cast nets into the shallows, while others engaged in playful games or meticulously worked on patches of *paraka*, a local cloth. They were his people now. Canoes rested on the sand, and empty houses stood as silent witnesses to a time when war canoes were hauled up on rollers. These, too, felt like his responsibility.

But as his eyes traveled from the serene lagoon to the silent canoe houses, a shadow crossed his brow. Turning his back on the tranquil water, he faced the thunderous breakers and the northern sea. Out there, beyond the visible horizon, lay Palm Tree Island. Though beautiful as a dream, it was, he knew, teeming with devils.

Nearby, little Tari, son of Le Taioi, the net maker, sat on the coral. Tari's understanding of the world was limited, but he knew that war had swept away the men of Karolin, leaving the women, boys, and children vulnerable, without a leader.

Then, just yesterday, from the northern sea, a strange boat had appeared, bearing this new figure, Dick, and Katafa, a girl who had been lost at sea years ago during a fishing trip. The women whispered that he was sent by the gods to be their chief, their protector.

The child cared little for gods, but he was curious about this newcomer. Alone with Dick, and beyond his mother's earshot, he posed the direct question, with all the simplicity of childhood.

"Taori," little Tari asked, "who are you?" (*é kamina tai*)

Could Dick have truly answered, would the child have grasped the strange tale he might have told? *Tari, I come from a world beyond your imagining. My name was once Dick Lestrange, and when I was smaller than you, I was stranded with an old sailor on that island you call Marua, Palm Tree. There we lived, and Kearney, the sailor, taught me to fish and to spear, and he crafted toys for me, little ships unlike your canoes. Then, one day, Katafa, the girl who was swept away from Karolin, arrived. She lived with us until Kearney died, and then we were alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin. She named me Taori. We loved one another and might have lived forever on Marua, had not a great ship arrived, filled with cruel men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They came to cut the trees, but they turned on their white leaders, killing them and setting the ship ablaze. We escaped in our boat, taking with us everything we held dear, even the little ships, and steered for Karolin, guided by the lagoon light in the sky.*

But he could not reveal all of this to Tari, for the very name of Dick had faded from his memory. The language he had spoken as a child was gone. Kearney, the sailor who had raised him, was almost forgotten, lost in the luminous haze of his past.

The past, for men long shipwrecked and isolated, becomes a blurred and distant echo. For Dick, it began with Katafa's arrival on Marua. Everything before that was consumed in the blinding light of the tropics, the storms that lashed the coconut groves, the mists of the rainy seasons. Kearney lingered only as a dim memory, kept alive by the little toy ships he had made.

He looked down at the questioning child. "I am Taori, Tari tatu, why do you ask?"

"I do not know," the child replied. "I ask as I breathe. But no grown-up—*madyana*—ever answers Tari's questions. Ai, the fish!" His fleeting attention had already moved on, drawn by the cries of children hauling in a net. He darted away.

Dick turned his gaze north once more. The child's question had stirred something within him. He saw, once more, the schooner that had sought harbor at Palm Tree, only to be destroyed by the Melanesian crew. He saw Katafa and himself, fleeing in the old dinghy Kearney had taught him to sail. He recalled their arrival on this beach, the women and children swarming around him, hailing him as a god-sent chief.

As he stared north, the memory of the men from whom they had escaped tainted the beauty of the sea and sky.

There was no immediate threat from the men who had seized Palm Tree. They had no canoes, but they would build them. Surely, they would see the distant reflection of Karolin's lagoon in the sky, just as he had, and they would come. It might be a long time, but they would come.

Dick was now almost indistinguishable from the islanders, a *kanaka*, a savage. Yet, the white man still lingered within him. He could think ahead, reason through a problem, and imagine the future.

That was why, this morning, he had sent a canoe to the southern beach to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata – three old men, past fighting, but renowned canoe builders. That was why, as he observed the tribe, he noted the hundred or so youths approaching fighting age. But beneath all, fueling his mind and raising his courage, lay his love for Katafa, his other self, more precious than his own life, threatened, however faintly, by the looming danger.

War canoes. Did he intend to defend the lagoon from invaders, or attack them at their source before they could become a threat? Only time would tell.

A hand fell upon his shoulder. He turned to face Katafa. A strand of her dark hair had escaped the vine that bound it, dancing on the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her dark, luminous eyes were fixed on the horizon, the same point where he had been staring – due north.

"Look!" Katafa breathed.

Under certain weather conditions, Palm Tree, though beyond the horizon, became visible from Karolin through mirage. They had seen it the evening before. Now, it was beginning to emerge again, a mysterious stain low in the northern sky, a dull spot in the dazzling sea, deepening and solidifying as if sketched by an unseen artist. The island revealed itself, beautiful as a dream, diaphanous, yet vivid.

With her hand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, their minds untutored in the science of mirage. Their eyes were fixed on the place from which they had escaped, rising now, as if to gaze back at them.

They saw, once more, the horde of savages on the beach, figures distorted into nightmare shapes. They felt the wind that filled the sail as the dinghy raced for safety, and they heard the yells of the Melanesians, driven mad by stolen rum. And there, before them, lay the scene of the tragedy, a lovely tableau that concealed the demons within.

As Dick gazed at this beauty, which was also a threat and a warning, his nostrils flared, and his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him – that was nothing. They had threatened Katafa – that was everything. And they still threatened her.

Someday, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo the instinct in his heart. They would build canoes. Seeing the lagoon's light in the sky, they would come. Those men had no women, and here, on Karolin, were women. Instinct whispered that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scour the horizon for an island whose women could be stolen. They would see the lagoon light, and they would come.

If only he knew, danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred might roam on that azure sea, not just among savages, but also the wolves of civilization.

To Dick, there was no world beyond the waters that embraced the two islands; no Europe, no America, no history but the history of his short life and Katafa's. Yet, even in that short life, he had learned to dread men. He understood the foundation of all history – man's instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.

Then, gradually, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade. It vanished like a snuffed candle. As they turned from the sea towards the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.

It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they walked down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.
